# Billing and Prices

We bill only for the bandwidth. So, you pay only for what your website uses and nothing more. It’s as simple as abc.

* Imagine, you have a logo.png image which weights 1MB on your website.
* We compress it to 600KB.
* Let’s pretend that 100 users saw it.
* So, the calculation would be: 600KB \* 100 views = 60 MB of billed bandwidth.
