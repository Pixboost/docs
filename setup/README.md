# Tools and Setup

There is only one step that you need to do to start using Pixboost - [add at least one image source](adding-image-source.md). Pixboost will allow to transform images from those domains.

You will already have one active API key that you can use, but [you can add more or rotate them](manage-api-keys.md) in case you have different projects and don't want all eggs in one basket. It's definitely a good security practice to separate you API keys.
