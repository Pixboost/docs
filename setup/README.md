# Tools and Setup

There is only one step that you need to do to start using Pixboost - [add at least one image domain](adding-image-source.md) or image source.

You will already have one active API key that you can use, but [you can add more or rotate them](manage-api-keys.md) in case you have different projects and don't want to have all eggs in one basket. It's a good security practice separating you API keys.
