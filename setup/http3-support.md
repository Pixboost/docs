 # HTTP/3 Support
 
 Pixboost automatically supports HTTP/3 protocol.
 
 HTTP/3 was created to improve efficiency of the existed HTTP protocol by including several features:
 
 * HTTP/3 has better earlier data support
 * HTTP/3 has much faster handshakes
 * HTTP/3 does not exist in an insecure or unencrypted version. 


 This all makes it easier to deliver fast and efficient website. More on HTTP/3 protocol please read it's [official page](https://http3.net).
